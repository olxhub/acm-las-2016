<p>For all the classifications, an accuracy of over 0.7 was achieved, which illustrated that with only simple unigram features a good model, was able to be learnt for the individual MOOC course. </p>

<p>Which algorithm would you select to build models for the cross-MOOC classification evaluation?</p>

<div class="detailed-solution">
<p>Explanation</p>

<p>The best performing algorithm was the Support Vector Machine using a RBF kernel, which was then selected to build models for the cross-MOOC classification evaluation. </p>
