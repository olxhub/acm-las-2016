      <choice correct="true">No <choicehint>It is possible that the remaining 10% of assessments require mastery of a very different set of skills than the other 90%, which means that the student may still be missing some skills. The takeaway is that in a course that tests certain skills more than others, good grades can mask weaknesses in skills with less content coverage.</choicehint></choice>
