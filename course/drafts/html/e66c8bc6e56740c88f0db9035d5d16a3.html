<li>Data for each experiment was originally retrieved from the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure (ALI)</li>
<ul>
<li>More information on ALI can be found at <a href="http://www.assistmentstestbed.org/" target="[object Object]"><span color="#0066cc" style="color: #0066cc;">http://www.assistmentstestbed.org/</span></a></li>
<li>An example data retrieval file for an individual experiment with associated data can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gvXKNQZIJ7K_-ETWSJblM9_pbQlsmb6BHxSa1TFbOqo/edit?usp=drivesdk" target="[object Object]"><span color="#0066cc" style="color: #0066cc;">here</span></a></li>
</ul>
<li>Remove problems not common to all experiments</li>
<ul>
<li>Removed pretest and posttest</li>
<ul>
<li>At the time most experiments did not have pretest and posttest as that functionality did in ASSISTments until recently</li>
</ul>
<li>Remove scaffold problems</li>
<ul>
<li>Only a few problems had them</li>
<li>Considered tutoring and not problems</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<li>Derive what experimental condition a student was assigned to&nbsp;based on the problems</li>
<li>Add column for whether a student could see video if the experiment contained problems with video</li>
