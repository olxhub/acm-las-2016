<li>Chose experiments that are <em>Skill Builders</em></li>
<ul>
<li>A Skill Builder is an assignment type where students must answer three problems correctly to complete.&nbsp; Problems are randomly chosen from a bank of 50-100 similar problems.</li>
<li>Only Skill Builders were chosen because that was the most common assignment structure shared amongst the randomized controlled experiments.</li>
</ul>
<li>Chose experiments with a single control group and a single treatment group</li>
<ul>
<li>These experiments were chosen because this was the most common design</li>
</ul>
<li>Chose experiments that had over 50 students complete the assignment in all conditions</li>
<ul>
<li>This was done to ensure a large enough sample size for each experiment</li>
</ul>
