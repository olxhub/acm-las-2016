<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">What we did</span></p>
<p>We&nbsp;synthesized a&nbsp;dataset that consists of 22 randomized controlled experiments run inside the <a href="https://www.assistments.org/" target="[object Object]"><br />ASSISTments Online Learning Platform</a></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">What makes this dataset special</span></p>
<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>
<li>All experiments were run in the&nbsp;same experimental setting</li>
<li>All experiments had the same student features</li>
</ol></ol></ol></ol></ol></ol>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Why is this important</span></p>
<ol><ol><ol><ol><ol>
<li>This allows us to create and evaluate models across multiple experiments</li>
<li>This allows us to do data mining with a better chance for the results to generalize</li>
