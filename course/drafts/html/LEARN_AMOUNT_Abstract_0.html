One feature of many systems is differentiating the amount of practice users receive. To do this, some systems rely on a threshold of consecutive correct responses. For instance, Khan Academy used to use ten correct in a row and now uses five correct in a row as the mastery threshold. The present research uses a series of randomized control trials, conducted in an online learning platform (eg., ASSISTments.org), to explore the effects of different thresholds of consecutive correct responses on learning. Results indicate that despite spending significantly more time practicing there is no significant difference on learning between two, three, four, or five consecutive correct responses. This suggests that systems, and MOOCS, can employ the simple rule of two or three consecutive correct responses when determining the amount of practice provided to users.</p>
