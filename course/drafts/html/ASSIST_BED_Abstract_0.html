<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Welcome. As our live work is a Demonstration, the content in this course is intended to help users working with the ASSISTments TestBed. The TestBed revolutionizes educational research by making it simple for researchers to design and implement low cost, high power, noninvasive randomized controlled experiments that feature student level randomization at scale and leverage ASSISTments' pre-existing content and user population. It is a unique collaborative funded by the National Science Foundation through an SI2 grant that connects researchers and;authentic learning environments with simplicity.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">An introduction to the ASSISTments TestBed and the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure</span></li>
<li>Pointers to useful resources to answer any additional questions</li>
<li>A dataset with&nbsp;output from&nbsp;actual randomized controlled experiment conducted using the ASSISTments TestBed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">As a researcher, as you progress through the next few steps you will learn the benefits of using the ASSISTments TestBed, you will learn the typical workflow progression we follow, how to make an ASSISTments account to&nbsp;get started, and how to access data from the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure (ALI). We hope you enjoy this course and if you have any questions, please feel to contact us at assistments-research@wpi.edu</span></p>
