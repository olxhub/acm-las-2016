<p>We used the dataset presented here and submitted&nbsp;the following paper to Educational Data Mining 2016.&nbsp; In this paper, we introduced a new method to analyze multiple randomized control experiments at the same time. We called this method TAME (Trained Across Multiple Experiments). We did simulation study to compare TAME against ANOVA and use this dataset to see how TAME performs on the real data.</p>
