<p>In the paper we present several design scenario's of open learning (online masterclasses and MOOCs implemented in different platforms). What they have in common are design principles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design principles that fit open education and open learning format formed the focus of an expert discussion "The borders of instructional design?" which was held during the Open Education Week webinar series of the Open University Netherlands.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Prof. Dr. Liesbeth Kester and Dr. Peter van Rosmalen were the invited experts. Dr. Olga Firssova moderated the discussion.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Join this discussion by reflecting on the main topics of the recorded webinar. Use the following questions as a guideline.</p>
<ul>
<li>What can we learn from instructional design principles to improve (massive) open online courses?</li>
<li>How&nbsp;is the learner taken care of the&nbsp;(massive) open online courses?</li>
<li>How are we going beyond the computer in the&nbsp;(massive) open online courses?</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Reflect on the statement made by Liesbeth Kester during the discussion in the webinar:</p>
<p><em><strong>A MOOC needs&nbsp;be designed but the learner might want something entirely different. How these two worlds can be matched?</strong></em></p>
<p>Use discussion forum to post your thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
