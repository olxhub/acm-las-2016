<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">Conducting educational research at scale has traditionally carried high costs, room for error, and has infringed on natural learning processes. Online learning platforms offer a perfect solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><i>&gt;&gt; step&nbsp;</i><i>&gt;&gt; Prezi moves to zoom on Article 1 (Quote/Video)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">One such platform, ASSISTments, is pioneering a new approach to educational research. This popular online tutoring system offers an authentic learning environment in which researchers can observe the effects of educational interventions. Teachers use ASSISTments to assign classwork and homework to over 50,000 students around the world, with over 12.5&nbsp;million problems solved in the last&nbsp;school year. The tool is a free service of Worcester Polytechnic Institute that provides students with immediate feedback while enhancing classroom practices through robust formative assessment.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>&gt;&gt; step</i>&nbsp;</span><i>&gt;&gt; Prezi moves to zoom on Article 2 (Workflow</i>)</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The new ASSISTments TestBed revolutionizes educational research by making it simple for researchers to design and implement low cost, high power, noninvasive randomized controlled experiments that feature student level randomization and leverage ASSISTments&rsquo; pre-existing content and user population. The TestBed is a unique collaborative funded by an NSF SI2 grant that brings researchers together with students and teachers to study effective learning interventions while iteratively improving the user experience.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span><i>&gt;&gt; step&nbsp;</i><i>&gt;&gt; Prezi moves to zoom on Article 3 (ALI)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">When using the ASSISTments TestBed, researchers are also assisted by the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure (or ALI), a new data retrieval and analysis tool that was recently unveiled at the Learning Analytics &amp; Knowledge Conference. ALI provides researchers with organized anonymized reports detailing student performance that streamline analytic efforts.&nbsp;By collecting anonymous data, researchers are also able to easily meet IRB restrictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ASSISTments TestBed and ALI make educational research at scale more feasible and much more accessible to researchers. There are currently over 130 randomized controlled experiments running in the ASSISTments TestBed.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>&gt;&gt; step</i>&nbsp;</span><i>&gt;&gt; Prezi moves to zoom on Article 4 (SRI)</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">But why should researchers trust ASSISTments and the TestBed as viable resources representing authentic learning? SRI International, an independent non-profit research firm known for objective analysis, designed an Efficacy Study to test ASSISTments. The U.S. Department of Education funded the two-year randomized controlled experiment through a $3.5M grant. The study examined school level randomization of ASSISTments as a platform to support online homework, with 44 schools, 87 teachers, and over 3,000 7th grade students in the State of Maine participating.&nbsp; Preliminary results suggest that the use of ASSISTments was linked to an average 10 point gain on end of the year state tests, a significant result with a powerful effect size.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><i>&gt;&gt; step</i>&nbsp;</span><i>&gt;&gt; Prezi returns to home view</i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The TestBed can lower the stakes of educational research by drastically reducing costs, promoting validated universal measures of achievement, and assisting researchers through the process of designing, implementing, and analyzing randomized controlled experiments within authentic educational environments. This work was funded by the National Science Foundation.</p>
