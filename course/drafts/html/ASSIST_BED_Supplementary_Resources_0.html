<h4>About the&nbsp;Presenters</h4>
<h5>Korinn Ostrow -&nbsp;<a href="tiny.cc/ksostrow" target="[object Object]">tiny.cc/ksostrow</a></h5>
<p>Korinn is finishing her 3rd year of her PhD work in the Learning Sciences &amp; Technologies program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). She is advised by Neil Heffernan, and serves as a proud member of the ASSISTments Research Team. Her background is rooted in cognitive psychology and applied quantitative research&nbsp;methods, with a B.S. in Psychology from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Her research has been focused on increasing student motivation and engagement within online learning platforms, but her dissertation work is now pivoting to the promotion of&nbsp;transparency in the development and evaluation of online tutoring systems. She is designing a conceptual framework that will&nbsp;help researchers pinpoint system&nbsp;features that promote efficacy and will simultaneously help consumers of these systems gauge what works best for students.</p>
<h5>Neil Heffernan -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.neilheffernan.net" target="[object Object]">www.neilheffernan.net</a></h5>
<p>Neil Heffernan is a Professor of Computer Science and the Director of the Learning Sciences and Technologies Graduate Program at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. He is best known for creating ASSISTments. He has used the platform to conduct and publish two- dozen randomized controlled experiments, and now strives to expand the platform as a tool for others to do the same. In addition, he has published three dozen papers in predictive analysis, using large educational datasets to predict student performance on standardized state tests, affective states like boredom and frustration, and even college admission years later. He cares deeply about helping others learn about personalized learning in a methodically rigorous way.</p>
