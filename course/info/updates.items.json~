We'd ask you to step through the sequences for all of the full papers before showing up to the second day of Learning@Scale to be prepared for the flipped activities at the conference. \n</p>\n<p>\n  You may enjoy working through many of the work-in-progress papers. We were impressed with the quality of some of the presentations there as well. \n</p>\n<p>\n  If you'd like to reuse any of the materials in this course, please fork us <a href=\"https://github.com/olxhub/acm-las-2016\">on github</a>. This course is playable in <a href=\"https://github.com/edx/edx-platform\">any Open edX install</a> (and, hopefully eventually, other OLX players).\n</p>",
