<h3>Sample Screens from XAnalytics</h3>

<p>The image slider below shows examples of what XAnalytics looks like, with data from a real course. In this case, the course is the second run of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/super-earths-life-harvardx-spu30x-0" target="_blank">Super-Earths and Life</a> from 2015. Click the top images to navigate, or click the bottom ones for a larger view.</p>

<div class="hx-bigslider">
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_top.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_top.png" alt="" /></a>The top of the XAnalytics dashboard shows basic course facts: number of registrants, number of people who have "viewed" or "explored" the course, the amount of various types of content in the course (video/html/problem), etc.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_content.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_content.png" alt="" /></a>This screen shows how many views there have been in each course section ("chapter" here). Clicking on the chapter name will take you to a more detailed view as shown in the next image.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_Exo.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_Exo.png" alt="" /></a>Here we see detailed information about each piece of the course, including some simple statistics for each assesment. Clicking on the assessment takes you to a screen that shows response histograms and even individual student responses (not shown here).</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_activity.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_activity.png" alt="" /></a>A graph of student activity over time. The bar on the bottom allows you to zoom in on a particular timescale. The scale is more granular than in Insights, showing day-by-day activity. You can also see one particular day with missing data, where the activity is reported as zero.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_enrollment.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_enrollment.png" alt="" /></a>A graph of enrollment over time. XAnalytics can show not just general enrollment, but also enrollment for specific groups, such as those who completed the course.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_location.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_location.png" alt="" /></a>A graphical representation of enrollment by country. XAnalytics also shows a table with this information. Nothing in XAnalytics is presented purely graphically - you can always find a table and/or download the raw data.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_USA.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_USA.png" alt="" /></a>Enrollment map by state for the USA.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_region.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_region.png" alt="" /></a>Percentage of course-viewers (note: not enrollees) by UN-designated geographical region. This is an excellent example of a custom report, which can be tailored to a particular subgroup of students and shown in a variety of ways.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT1.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT1.png" alt="" /></a>IRT discrimination and difficulty table for the assessments in Super-Earths. Uses a 2PL model by default.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT2.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT2.png" alt="" /></a>IRT characteristic curves for each item in the course. A planned feature is to make this a more interactive display, with roll-over information available for each curve.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT3.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT3.png" alt="" /></a>A plot of discrimination versus difficulty for all the problems in Super-Earths. This plot shows roll-over information for each dot, making it easier to determine which items are the outliers.</p>
<p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT4.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_XA_IRT4.png" alt="" /></a>A plot of average problem score vs. IRT difficulty for each problem. A characteristic S-curve shape can be seen, with some potential outliers on the bottom right-hand side.</p>
