<h3 class="western" lang="en-US">Scientific and Technical Objectives</h3>
<p class="western" lang="en-US">Intelligent tutoring systems enable students to access learning opportunities beyond the classroom, complementing existing face-to-face courses and supporting independent study. Natural language interaction in such a system is key to transitioning effective classroom techniques to the online domain, including active experimentation, self-explanation, and formative feedback.</p>

<p class="western" lang="en-US">The goal of the Beetle-Grow project is to lay the foundation for the next generation of intelligent tutoring systems by building a data collection system to support effective natural language based instruction in intelligent tutoring systems.</p>
