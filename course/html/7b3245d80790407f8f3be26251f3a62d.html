<h4>The reliability of the holistic model</h4>
<p>In order to&nbsp;test the proposed model, learners' 'motivation', 'course experience' and 'satisfaction' sub=scales were tested.&nbsp;Reliability test was performed and the Cronbach's alpha &gt;0.9 in most of the sub-scales indicate high internal correlation, as shown in the following table.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Motivation</h4>
<p><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Factor analysis was performed to reveal insight in the 'motivation' sub-scale, into the dimensions that bring the learners to the courses. The results show a 4-factor structure in INTSE and P2P, and a 2-factor in PMED (displayed in the following table).&nbsp;</span></p>
<center><span style="line-height: 25.6px;"><img src="/static/motivation_factor_analysis.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" height="443" width="610" /></span></center>
<p><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">Using the first model as comparison, in INTSE the following interpretation of the factors can be extracted.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-US">- Factor I: reasons related to the MOOCs as a new form of education, enables learners to experience reputable and quality online education. The &lsquo;social&rsquo; dimension stands out with the MOOCs perceived as a means to develop social network within the discipline. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">- Factor II: emphasizes lifelong learning. Learners who have such mindsets pursuit opportunities to upskill and further develop themselves. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">- Factor III: focuses on academic commitment, as doing this particular MOOC seems directly relevant to their academic progress or development. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">- Factor IV: includes reasons related to career and professional development oriented.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"></p>
<p class="MsoNoSpacing"><span lang="EN-US">P2P follows a similar factor structure of four factors, but with some variations (possibly reflected by the difference in participants). PMED on the other hand shows two factors that are job-oriented and loosely associated with course features (e.g. course topic and the offering university). Notably, PMED only adopted a subset of the items used in the other courses (tagged with N/A in Table 6), though they explained 62% of the variance, whilst the INTSE ones did 59% and the P2P ones 61%.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h4>Course experience</h4>
<p>Factor analysis was performed to reveal insight in the 'course experience' subscale, into the possible dimensions that constitute an experience of a learner (see figure below). The factor structure across the MOOCs is almost identical, despite slight differences in the use of questions in the different surveys.&nbsp;</p>
<center><img src="/static/course_experience_factor_analysis.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" height="466" width="548" /></center>
<p>It is important to point out that the factor structure confirms a similar pattern to that observed in the university's end-of-semester survey with almost all items fitting under an 'overall satisfaction' construct. This is one of the most important findings because it suggests that the conceptual framework to define the experience of learning does not change in MOOCs, on the contrast, it presents similar characteristics to traditional courses.</p>
