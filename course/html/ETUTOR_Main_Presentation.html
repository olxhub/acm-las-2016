<p>Faculty development in the area of emerging technologies is demanding and resource intensive. This increases when aiming to qualify instructors to support their teaching virtually, e.g. in blended- and distance learning environments. Most elements of instructional design, delivery, and assessment require rethinking for technology integration. It is also a challenge to develop a sound instructional design model and corresponding teaching materials for courses aimed at developing the necessary skills and competences among staff. <strong>With &ldquo;e-Tutor&rdquo; a corresponding certificate course</strong> was developed at Ankara University.</p>
