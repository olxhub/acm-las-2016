<p>In October 2014, one-time MOOC developer Udacity completed its transition from primarily producing massive, open online courses to producing job-focused, project-based microcredentials called "Nanodegree" programs.</p>
<p>With this transition came a challenge: whereas MOOCs focus on automated assessment and peer-to-peer grading, project-based microcredentials would only be feasible with expert evaluation. With dreams of enrolling tens of thousands of students at a time, the major obstacle became project evaluation.</p>
<p>To address this, Udacity developed a system for hiring external experts as project reviewers. Now, a year and a half later, the system has been an incredible success. 120,000 projects have been evaluated in 18 months, with 50% evaluated within 2.5 hours and 90% evaluated within 24 hours of submission. More importantly, students rate the feedback they receive very highly at 4.8/5.0.</p>
<p>In this presentation, we discuss the structure of the project review system, including the nature of the projects, the structure of the feedback, and the data described above.</p>
<p>Author's Note: Note that the numbers in the paper and title were accurate in October 2014. The numbers used in this presentation are accurate as of April 2016. While student satisfactions have remained consistent across that time, the rate of project review has risen in both reviews per day (from 300 reviews per day to 450) and turnaround time (from 127 minutes to 87 minutes).</p>
