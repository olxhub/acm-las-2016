<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>We are exploring the effects of social incentives and motivation on learner performance in a massive open online course.</p>
<p>In this flipped poster we describe a study where we asked learners if they wanted to be considered for a community TAship in a subsequent offering of the course, if they finished in the top 20% of those who completed the current course instance.</p>
<p>Our hope is to find small interventions like this that can influence learner performance without requiring the class to be redesigned.</p>
<p>After describing our study we ask you to give your intuition about what will happen&nbsp;and then report our results.</p>
