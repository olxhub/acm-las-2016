<h3>Abstract</h3>

<p>We are exploring the <strong>effects of social incentives on learner motivation and performance</strong> in a massive open online course.</p>
<p>In this flipped poster we describe a study where we asked learners if they wanted to be considered for a community TAship in a subsequent offering of the course, if they finished in the top 20% of those who completed the current course instance.</p>
<p>Our hope is to find <strong>small interventions</strong> like this that can influence learner performance without requiring the class to be redesigned.</p>
<p>After describing our study we ask you to <strong>give your intuition</strong> about what will happen&nbsp;and then report our results.</p>
