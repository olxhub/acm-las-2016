<p>Benefits, such as scalability for MOOCs and higher order learning, and challenges, such as grading accuracy and rogue reviewers, are described. Common practices and the state-of-the-art to counteract challenges are highlighted.</p>
<p>Based on this research, the paper at hand describes a peer assessment workflow and its implementation on the openHPI and openSAP MOOC platforms. This workflow combines the best practices of existing peer assessment tools and introduces some small but crucial improvements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We evaluated our implementation during 4 courses. Two on openSAP and two on openHPI. The settings for the peer assessments were quite different between each of the courses. In one course the peer assessment was mandatory, in the others they were offered as bonus material. The openSAP courses offered a tablets or laptops as a reward for the best solutions that were handed in.</p>
<p>To evaluate our work we conducted a couple of surveys and analyzed the data that we collected on the platforms during the peer assessments.</p>
<p>During the following section I will give you some insights to the inner workings of the system.</p>
<p>I will also discuss some of the key findings of our paper in one of the videos:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">The possibility for the participants to rate the reviews that they receive and the other way round to earn points for reviews that receive good ratings.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">The&nbsp;distribution mechanism that prioritizes the submissions of participants that have already reviewed the work of their peers.</span></li>
