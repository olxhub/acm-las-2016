<p>Here, put in a learning sequence about your course material. Ideally, this would be a few elements. Engage the conference participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions</li>
<li>Collect feedback</li>
<li>Let people interact with your technology, data, or results</li>
</ul>
<p>Keep the time here reasonably bounded. There will be many papers.&nbsp;</p>
