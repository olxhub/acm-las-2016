<h4>Problem</h4>
<p>If a friend&nbsp;handed you a deck&nbsp;of flashcards and asked you to quiz her, what would you do? One approach might be to show her&nbsp;randomly selected cards, or to shuffle the deck and cycle through the cards one by one. You might even use an adaptive teaching strategy to repeat cards that she forgets or incorrectly recalls. Unfortunately, this class of strategies is not effective&nbsp;for reviewing large decks, since the time between reviews of&nbsp;a given card grows linearly with the size of the deck&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;">&ndash;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;the student is&nbsp;overwhelmed, and forgets cards before they&nbsp;can be reviewed and reinforced.</span></p>
