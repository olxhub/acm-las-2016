<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>While explanations may help people learn by providing information about why an answer is correct, many problems on&nbsp;online platforms lack high-quality explanations. This paper&nbsp;presents AXIS (Adaptive eXplanation Improvement System),&nbsp;a system for obtaining explanations. AXIS asks learners to&nbsp;generate, revise, and evaluate explanations as they solve a&nbsp;problem, and then uses machine learning to dynamically determine which explanation to present to a future learner, based&nbsp;on previous learners&rsquo; collective input. Results from a case&nbsp;study deployment and a randomized experiment demonstrate&nbsp;that AXIS elicits and identifies explanations that learners find&nbsp;helpful. Providing explanations from AXIS also objectively&nbsp;enhanced learning, when compared to the default practice&nbsp;where learners solved problems and received answers without&nbsp;explanations. The rated quality and learning benefit of AXIS&nbsp;explanations did not differ from explanations generated by an&nbsp;experienced instructor.</p>
