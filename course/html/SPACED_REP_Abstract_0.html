<p>Flashcards are a popular study tool for exploiting the spacing effect&nbsp;<span style="color: #222222; font-family: arial, sans-serif; line-height: 19.2px;">&ndash;</span><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;the phenomenon in which periodic, spaced review of educational content improves long-term retention. The Leitner system is a simple heuristic algorithm for scheduling reviews such that forgotten items are reviewed more frequently than recalled items. We propose a formalization of the Leitner system as a queueing network model, and formulate optimal review scheduling as a throughput-maximization problem. Through simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that the Leitner Queue Network (LQN) model has desirable properties and gives insight into general principles for spaced repetition.</span></p>
