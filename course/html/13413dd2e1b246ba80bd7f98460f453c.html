<h3>Validity of the model</h3>
<p>In order to test the model, it was necessary to determine whether the underlying conepts and definitions were appropriate and shared by others in the community.</p>
<p>In the first part of this 'flipped poster', we asked you to enter your own definitions of four different terms: 1) student experience; 2) student engagement; 3) student satisfaction and 4) student evaluation of teaching.</p> 
<p> Below you can see the snapshot of current submissions.</p>

<iframe src="https://dare.teaching.unsw.edu.au/L@S16_comments.html" width="100%" height="1100px" overflow=auto></iframe>

<p>From the variety of responses above, it is possible to notice three patterns:</p>
  <ul>
<li>there is <strong>some consistency </strong>in the definitions for <strong>the same term</strong></li>
<li>there are <strong>similarities</strong> between the responses <strong>in different definitions</strong> (room for interpretation)</li>
<li>there is a <strong>great variety of interpretations</strong>, focus, and scope</li>
</ul>

    <td  style="padding:5px;" width="24%"><strong>Course Enablers</strong> are the key features of the educational platform, the course designs and mode of teaching to support learning. </td>
    <td  style="padding:5px;" width="24%"><strong>Precursors</strong> are students’ prior academic and professional experience, motivations, aspirations and expectations of learning. </td>
    <td  style="padding:5px;" width="24%"><strong>Engagement </strong>is the totality of learners’ interactions with the platform, peers, and the course. </td>
    <td  style="padding:5px;"width="29%">The <strong>Worth of Experience</strong> is what learners take away and project to their future, evaluating the learning experience, their satisfaction with the course, the perceived utility and effectiveness of the course for their learning, and/or for the development of knowledge and skills.</td>
