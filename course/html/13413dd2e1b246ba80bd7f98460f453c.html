<p>In order to test the model, it was necessary to determine whether the underlying conepts and definitions were appropriate and shared by others in the community.</p>
<p>In the first part of this 'flipped poster', we asked you to enter your own definitions of four different terms: 1) student experience; 2) student engagement; 3) student satisfaction and 4) student evaluation of teaching.</p> 
<p> Below you can see the snapshot of current submissions.</p>

<p>From the variety of responses above, it is possible to notice three patterns:
<li>there is <strong>some consistency </strong>in the definitions for <strong>the same term</strong></li>
<li>there are <strong>similarities</strong> between the responses <strong>in different definitions</strong> (room for interpretation)</li>
<li>there is a <strong>great variety of interpretations</strong>, focus, and scope</li>
