<h4>Model Predictions</h4>
<p>The key prediction of our model is that a<span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;<em>phase transition</em> occurs when the arrival rate of new items exceeds a predicted threshold, leading to a sharp decrease in the rate of learning. We verify the existence of this phase transition near the predicted threshold through simulations and a controlled experiment on <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome" target="[object Object]">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>, which give us confidence in the accuracy and usefulness of the queueing model.</span></p>
<p>Odds are that you have experienced something akin to this&nbsp;phase transition&nbsp;at some point during your education (e.g., a tough week of school when&nbsp;you got behind on classes because you were busy with other activities, or the classes had a synchronized burst of assignments). What did you do to overcome the build-up of content that needed to be learned and reviewed?</p>
