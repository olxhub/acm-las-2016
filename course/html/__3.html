<li>What other effects would you hypothesize arising when equipping graders with the results of peer review?</li>
<li>How would the effects of this system differ in other classes? In other subjects? At other levels?</li>
<li>Given that the effects are all in quality, not efficiency, could this system actually help scale? Or is it only capable of improving feedback quality?</li>
