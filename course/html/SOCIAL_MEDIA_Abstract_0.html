<p>The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) paradigm has experienced rapid development and attained worldwide attention from a variety of populations. However, high drop out rate become a salient issue. Many studies have focused on understanding this phenomenon and employed different mechanisms to enhance retention. Social media has been used as a way to enhance sense of community in MOOCs and improve student engagement and retention, motivating MOOC instructors to use social media for their courses. However there exists a lack of (1) empirical understandings of social media use and engagement compared to official MOOC forums and (2) rationales of social media use from both instructors&rsquo; and students&rsquo; perspectives. We attempted to understand these questions through the collection and analysis of the real usage data from three MOOC forums and the associated social media (i.e., Facebook) groups as well as the interviews from a total of sixteen instructors and students. We found that students show higher engagement and retention in social media than the forums, and identified both instructors&rsquo; and students&rsquo; perspectives that lead to the results. We discuss design implications for future MOOC platforms.</p>
