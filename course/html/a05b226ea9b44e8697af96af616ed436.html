<p>We looked at three courses from Coursera: </p>
<ul>
<li>An arts course (summer 2013)</li>
<li>A qualitative course in creativity (Summer 2014)</li>
<li>A quantitative course in programming (Sprint 2014)</li>
</ul>
<p>Take a guess... How many enrolled students do you think there were on Coursera relative to Facebook? How many active?</p>
