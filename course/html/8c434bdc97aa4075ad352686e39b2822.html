<p>Understanding the experiences of learners in MOOCs lays the foundation of making informed decisions on course design and teaching, as well as providing valuable information about how participants prefer to engage with learning at scale. Like for traditional courses, the robustness (quality) and the effectiveness (the appropriateness of implementation) of evaluation instrument should assure the quality of the data captured, yet MOOCs present a number of additional challenges.</p>
<p>We began to compare the enabling features of the MOOC design and how these affect participants&rsquo; engagement. An A/B type testing with quick evaluations of the videos &lsquo;in-line&rsquo; is described. This clearly points to the benefit of a seamless experience, embedding both content and evaluation questions&nbsp; in the user interface, gauging an immediate feedback about learners&rsquo; perceptions about effectiveness. More is required to explore the relations between course characteristics (enablers) and the levels of engagement and satisfaction.</p>
<p>The analysis of the ratings of videos seems to show that more committed learners (i.e. paying participants) report higher levels of satisfaction with the effectiveness of the lectures for their learning. Further analysis will be performed on the patterns of engagement related to the survey data with questions about the effectiveness of the features/designs, which scaffold learning. Finally, we set to evaluate the <em>worth</em> of learners&rsquo; experience in participating in MOOCs. The analysis showed that the satisfaction with the MOOCs is generally positive, however this is the result of a complex combination of&nbsp; factors, which reflect the intricacy of the relations between enablers (course features), precursors (student characteristics) and actual engagement. An interesting future avenue will be to explore further the value of certification and accreditation in relation to course design. More research will be required to further explore these relations and inform the future development of the courses.</p>
