<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">Contribution</span></p>
<p>We contribute a dataset consisting of 22 randomized controlled experiments run inside the ASSISTments online learning platform.&nbsp; This dataset is unique because it combined data from several different experiments all with a&nbsp; common design and common set of independent and dependent variables.&nbsp; We believe this dataset can be used for further analysis with a focus on finding general trends among independent variables across multiple experiments.</p>
