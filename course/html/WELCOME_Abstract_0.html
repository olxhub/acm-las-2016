<p>Welcome to the online component of the flipped&nbsp;track of learning at scale! For decades, we've known that <a href="http://www.physics.indiana.edu/~sdi/ajpv3i.pdf" target="[object Object]">interactive engagement pedagogies</a>&nbsp;help students learn in the classroom. We've seen <a href="https://www.edx.org/sites/default/files/upload/ed-tech-paper.pdf" target="[object Object]">similar results</a>&nbsp;for MOOC platforms correctly used in classrooms, along with <a href="http://web.mit.edu/fnl/volume/272/rayyan_belcher.html" target="[object Object]">greater student satisfaction</a>. We'd like to see whether we can&nbsp;do the same for the academic conference. As part of this great experiment, the authors of several papers at Learning@Scale&nbsp;put together this course on their papers. By moving this into a digital format,&nbsp;</p>
<p>The full papers contained here-in will not be presented in a traditional setting. <em><strong>You will need to work through the full papers section of this course before attending the flipped session at the conference. Otherwise, you will be lost when you get to the session.</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The edX interface consists of learning sequences, with controls at the top and bottom to navigate between elements.</p>

<p>Each paper is in one learning sequence.&nbsp;When you're done reading this, click the next button at the top or at the bottom to advance to the next element of&nbsp;this sequence.&nbsp;</p>
