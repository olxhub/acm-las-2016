<p>Indeed, students on Facebook were retained at a much greater rate. The difference was striking:</p>
<p><img src="/static/fall_off.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" height="640" width="391" /></p>
<p>Note that this is a correlation. We don't know the causality. More engaged students may simply be more likely to come onto Facebook. Also do note the rather large amount of noise which may limit statistical significance. In the next section, we'll collect some qualitative evidence for why this might be the case.</p>
