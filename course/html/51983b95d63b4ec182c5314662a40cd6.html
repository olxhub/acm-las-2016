<ul>
<li>There are 30 other features. Many&nbsp;of the features are self-explanatory and most features' description can be found here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.assistmentstestbed.org/the-data/ali-doc-request/interpreting-your-data-v-1-0" target="[object Object]">http://www.assistmentstestbed.org/the-data/ali-doc-request/interpreting-your-data-v-1-0</a></li>
<li>There are some features that are derived specifically for this dataset, including:</li>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 25.6px; font-size: 1em;">"ExperiencedCondition" indicates whether the student has experience the difference of the conditions.</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 25.6px; font-size: 1em;">In some experiments, some students may not experience the difference between the two conditions. For instance, if&nbsp;in the experiment condition students who answer incorrectly were given video hints, while in the control condition they were given text hints, then students who immediately answer 3 questions correctly do not&nbsp;experience the difference and should not be considered affected by the condition.</span></li>
</ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 25.6px;">"Saw Video"&nbsp;indicates whether the student can see videos.</span></li>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">In several RCE, we compare video hints vs&nbsp;text hints. We implemented a question that check whether the students can see videos or not. However, at the time of the experiments, the system was unable to direct students who could not see videos to non-video conditions. As a result, every student was randomly assigned to either video condition or text condition regardless of whether they could see videos or not.</span></li>
