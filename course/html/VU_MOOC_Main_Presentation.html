<p>In this experiment, we are investigating what we call &ldquo;lightweight&rdquo; social interventions into open online courses. Lightweight interventions are intended to motivate learner engagement in an online course, while not requiring that the course be substantially redesigned.</p>
<p>Our poster describes our lightweight intervention in a MOOC to see whether it increases any types of engagement, most notably the completion of homework assignments.</p>
<p>In particular, we hypothesized that the possibility of becoming a Community TA would incentivize some students to increase their engagement in a course.</p>
<p>We tested our hypothesis in the third session of a MOOC teaching the Matlab programming language, offered by Vanderbilt University through Coursera. This was a popular course, with an enrollment of nearly 15 thousand at the time our experiment started. There was prestige in being a Community TA as was apparent in the previous two sessions of the course. Students who took the post course survey of earlier sessions expressed strong interest in becoming a community TA in future offerings.</p>

<p>A day before the first assignment was due in the Matlab course, we emailed half of the enrolled learners, asking them whether they would like to be considered for a community TAship in the next course offering if they completed the current session in the top 20%. This was the experimental group.</p>
<p>The other half of learners, which was the control group, did not get this email.</p>

<p>We wanted to see if this prompt motivated learners in the experimental group to complete more assignments at higher scores than the control group, and whether course completion rates and scores were similarly affected.</p>
<p>To analyze these results we looked at the difference in participation rates and scores for each assignment in the course between the experimental and control groups.</p>
