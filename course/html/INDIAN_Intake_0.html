<p>Imagine yourself as a researcher in the following low-resource context:</p>
<p><em>"You are working in a village in rural India to provide better education facilities and learning content. In this village, power is available for only three hours a day, and internet connectivity is poor and limited. There is a single story school building, with three classrooms and more students than those that can fit in these classrooms. The students possibly come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, and different castes. They are in the 8 years to 13 years age group, and most of them are boys, since many girls tend to drop out at the age of 12 years."</em></p>
