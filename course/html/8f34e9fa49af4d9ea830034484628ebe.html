<h4>General Approach</h4>
<p>We develop a&nbsp;formal queueing model based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_system" target="[object Object]">Leitner system</a>&nbsp;that yields a simple scheduling algorithm and streaming mechanism&nbsp;that maximizes the rate of learning, and prevents the student from being overwhelmed by too much material. Flashcards are routed through a network of queues as follows:</p>
<p><img src="/static/lqn.png" alt="" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" preventdefault="function (){r.isDefaultPrevented=n}" stoppropagation="function (){r.isPropagationStopped=n}" stopimmediatepropagation="function (){r.isImmediatePropagationStopped=n}" isdefaultprevented="function t(){return!1}" ispropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" isimmediatepropagationstopped="function t(){return!1}" width="851" height="580" /></p>
<p>After the user sees an item for the first time, it enters the system at deck 1. Each deck is a first-in-first-out queue, and when the user requests an item to review, the system randomly chooses a deck \(i\), and shows the user the item at the top of deck \(i\). If the user forgets the item, it is added to the bottom of deck \(i &minus; 1\). If the user recalls the item, it is added to the bottom of deck \(i + 1\). When the user recalls an item at deck \(n\), the item has been "mastered", so it exits the system. Deck \(i\) is chosen with probability proportional to a controllable service rate \(\mu_i\), which is&nbsp;typically decreasing in \(i\) so that lower decks are reviewed more often than higher decks (why?).</p>
