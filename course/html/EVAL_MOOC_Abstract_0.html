<h3>Abstract</h3>
<h4>What is the purpose of our paper?</h4>
<p>Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have attracted people worldwide to learn a variety of subjects, when and how they want it, at low or no cost to themselves. MOOCs are often built and offered by higher education institutions to harness and learn best practice by experimenting with educational design.</p>
<p>Whilst most research has made inferences about the experience of learners from their interaction with the online platform, few have fully considered the rich feedback provided by learners themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What did we do?</h4>
<p>Over 8900 MOOC participants took part, with a variety of methods -including short answers and surveys- to evaluate their experience and engagement with the MOOCs developed by a large public research intensive Australian University.</p>
<p>This paper focuses on the analysis and comparison of the range of evaluation tools adopted in four MOOCs selected for their specific characteristics. The response data, combined with some activity data, provides an integrated view into aspects of "student" experience.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>What are the key results?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Preliminary evidence suggested that enabling features of the MOOCs course design affect learners' participation in various ways;</li>
<li>A/B-type testing suggested that the integration of feedback collection with activities works&nbsp;more effectively in capturing learners' perceptions of their experiences;</li>
<li>Preliminary evidenc suggests that the model used for students in HE could also be applied to evaluate the worth of experience in MOOCs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The results inform how universities might view and evaluate the experience in MOOCs compared with that in current traditional education. The findings contribute to: (1) the description of individual precursors that motivate learners to enroll; (2) a better understanding of the enabling characteristics of participation in a MOOC; (3) a characterization of how participants engage and learn in a course; and (4) the evaluation of the worth of their experience in participating.</p>
