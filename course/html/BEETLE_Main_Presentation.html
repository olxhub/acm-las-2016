<p>This approach encourages students to think deeply about the phenomena that they observe and to attempt to infer the underlying explanatory principles in the domain. User studies have shown it to be highly eﬀective, producing signiﬁcant pre- to post-test learning gains.</p>

<p>Students use natural language to answer questions in a familiar &lsquo;chat&rsquo;-style interface. The interactive circuit workbench allows learners to experiment freely.</p>
<p>Student interaction data and other indicators of learning are logged in a format suitable for data mining and as training data for machine learning. The system is designed for large-scale data collection, while also delivering a valuable learning experience in its own right.</p>
