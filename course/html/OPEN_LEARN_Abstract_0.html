<p>Our paper 'Designing for Open Learning: Design Principles and Scalability Affordances in Practice' elaborates on a gradually evolving approach to design of open learning and the design principles used by the Open University of the Netherlands in short open courses - online masterclasses and in Massive Open Online Courses &ndash; delivered in the learning environment of the Open University and in the experimental multilingual MOOC aggregator EMMA as part of a European project. As the paper will demonstrate, these principles can be seen as building blocks of open scalable design of active and engaging learning.</p>

<p>Why do we focus on&nbsp;design of open learning? &nbsp;In our paper we formulate a&nbsp;design challenge:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>In a Massive Open Online Course all are welcome, yet, it is not known how many will turn up, whether they will stay or not, what they will actually do once they turn up and choose to stay and how to support them in their learning.</em>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>How this challenge can be tackled effectively? Before you read what we think about the challenge and possible solutions, we invite you to share your opinion, your experience and considerations in the discussion. We will be able to continue at the L@S conference!</p>
