<h3>Where Do Dashboards Fit?</h3>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with course dashboards, this is a quick overview of how they relate to other parts of the course. This image shows a schematic; there is an explanation below. If you already know what MOOC instructor dashboards are, feel free to go to the next page.</p>

<p>Dashboards collect student activity and organize it in a way that makes it useful to course staff. Staff then use this information to inform students about how the course is going, and to alter this and future runs of the course.</p>

<p>Several items on this diagram are dotted lines, because these connections are possible but rare. Dashboards could be built to inform students and researchers, but they typically are not. They're made with just the course staff in mind. In addition, research findings make their way back to the students in some courses, but not in most.</p>
