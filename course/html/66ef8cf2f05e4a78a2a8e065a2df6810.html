<h3>Tutor Feedback</h3>
<p>Beetle-Grow analyses circuits submitted by students to check they are correct. If they are incorrect, an indication of the error&nbsp;is given. After three failed attempts by the student, the system presents the correct circuit.</p>

<p>As Beetle-Grow is designed primarily for data collection, no formative feedback is given for textual answers. Students' answers are logged and can be used to train statistical models, allowing future versions to provide tailored feedback. Instead, the system simply states the expected answer (a "bottom-out") and leaves the student to decide if their own answer was a close enough match. This behavior corresponds to the TELL condition used in previous Beetle II evaluations (<a href="http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/beetle-ii-deep-natural-language-understanding-and-automatic-feedback-generation-for-intelligent-tutoring-in-basic-electricity-and-electronics(cf690fd4-e83c-4e77-bbe7-9764268def41).html" target="[object Object]">Dzikovska et al., 2014</a>), which demonstrated that asking students for an explanation and then immediately giving away the correct answer was highly effective for learning, despite the obvious potential to &lsquo;game the system&rsquo; by typing minimal or nonsense answers.</p>

<p>This approach also avoids the negative effect on student satisfaction and engagement seen in previous evaluations due to the limitations of the natural language understanding and feedback selection modules used in Beetle II.</p>
