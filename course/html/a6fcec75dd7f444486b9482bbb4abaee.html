<p>Forum post classification, if performed in real time has the ability to provide valuable insight to instructors moderating and planning interventions within MOOC forums. The grand vision is to provide instructors with dashboards to easily evaluate student confusion, urgency and sentiment, more advanced collaborative learning classification schemes and Community of Inquiry models.

Current research has focused on training and testing classification models within a specific domain or course. The preliminary research presented in this paper, evaluates cross-domain MOOC classification accuracy for confusion, urgency and sentiment using the Stanford MOOCPosts dataset. While low cross-domain classification accuracy is achieved, the experiment highlights the need for transfer learning and domain adaptation algorithms; and provides insight into the types of algorithms required within an educational context.</p>
