<h3>The Curriculum</h3>
<p>Beetle-Grow uses the conceptual change method of instruction which has proven effectiveness (Duit and Treagust, 2003). This approach relies on two key elements:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">Students should be presented with evidence that contradicts their existing misconceptions.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 1em; line-height: 1.6em;">They should be guided to generate an accurate conception of the phenomena involved.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>

<p>To meet the needs of this kind of scientific instruction an intelligent tutoring system requires&nbsp;both a simulation environment for the ﬁrst part and tutorial dialogue capability for the second.</p>
<p>Beetle-Grow has these elements and incorporates approximately four hours of instruction, using content and activities drawn from the materials published by the Physics Education Group at the University of Washington (McDermott et al., 1995).</p>

<p>The curriculum covers topics such as open and closed paths, voltage, series and parallel circuits, and ﬁnding faults in a circuit with a voltmeter. The exercises themselves are designed to counter common misconceptions. Students are asked how they think a circuit will behave and then try out the circuit for themselves. Afterwards they are asked to compare their predictions with the experimental results and to explain the results.&nbsp;</p>
