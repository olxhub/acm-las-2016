We deployed a tablet (Android) application for Math learning and iterated on its design during a six-week study. We found that tablet apps were appropriate and feasible learning and assessment tools, opened up avenues for personalized learning, led to improved earning outcomes (as assessed by the tutors), and allowed for the consideration of different kinds of learning content (e.g. Math and English, which students in Tamil Nadu have been found to be weakest). These findings and subsequent discussions with the NGO and tutors motivated us towards proposing and deploying a holistic model that integrates mobile technologies and curated media into an online learning community.</span></div>

Few notable tools include Educomp smart school program which has digital repository of classroom learning content, bundled with lesson plans and assessment. Magic Pathshala, which has categorized Math and English content, sorted by skill and grades. A tablet based platform produced by CarveNiche technologies is WybeeTab. However, we found most online digital content providers are not open source, and most services are paid. Moreover, the main target was grades 9-12 high school, and competitive examinations for universities.</span></div>

Their experiences with digital content found by simple web search and their comfort level in their previous uses of digital media/devices gave crucial feedback to improve our design of technology. &nbsp;To note, we found told that children are more engaged when digital media (visual pictures/videos) are used to explain concepts. Another common theme that emerged was that students were far more enthusiastic than their teachers when it came to embracing the idea of an online learning community.The contextually relevant design based on feedback of teachers and students in low-resource contexts provides value to our intended users. If successful, our intervention would enable teachers and students improved opportunities to learning methods, which do not exist now. </span></div>

We propose a contextually relevant and feasible design and deployment of an online learning environment for use in low-resource after-school settings across India. Here, we draw on ethnographic research conducted in summer 2015 with an NGO working across 35 after-school classrooms in rural South India, contextual inquiries conducted across three low-resource settings in December 2015, and content analysis of educational materials available online. Our long-term objective is to </span></div>
