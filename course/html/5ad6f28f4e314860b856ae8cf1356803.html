<p>The goal of this flipped course is to provide you background on this work, and invite your feedback and questions, as well as future collaboration in ongoing research.</p>
<p>The central resource for discussion and activity at the flipped session will be a Google Document, which you can access by typing into your browser the URL <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U2EEZ5Ec0qV2kn01_HvSc5-qeO_lyWv5XBDgHC3cfFY/edit#" target="_blank">tiny.cc/axisgdoc</a>. Try opening it now. It also shows the planned activities for the flipped session.</p>
