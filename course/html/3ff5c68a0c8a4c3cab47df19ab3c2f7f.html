<h3>Sample Screens from Insights</h3>

<p>The image slider below shows examples of what edX Insights looks like, with data from a real course. In this case, the course is the second run of <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/super-earths-life-harvardx-spu30x-0" target="_blank">Super-Earths and Life</a> from 2015. Click the top images to navigate, or click the bottom ones for a larger view.</p>

<div class="hx-bigslider">
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Enrollment.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Enrollment.png" alt="" /></a>Student enrollment over time. This course experienced quite the spike in enrollment over two days, thanks to an advertisement taken out on the Facebook page <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IFeakingLoveScience" target="_blank">IFLS</a>.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Activity.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Activity.png" alt="" /></a>Student activity per week. Different lines indicate video watching, problem attempts, and overall activity. EdX Insights intentionally averages some data over the course of an entire week to present a less "jumpy" view, with the idea that students might do their work any time during the week.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Age.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Age.png" alt="" /></a>Student age histogram. This course is tilted slightly younger than most HarvardX courses, thanks to the Facebook ad.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Location.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Location.png" alt="" /></a>Student location map. Again, the impact of the Facebook ad is visible, shifting the student body more toward the USA than usual.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Wholecourse.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Wholecourse.png" alt="" /></a>Percent correct on all the subsections of the course. The percentages are particularly high in this course because it used partial credit. At the time of publication, Insights lumped partially correct responses in with correct responses. Eventually, partially correct responses will be shown in their own color.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Graded.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Graded.png" alt="" /></a>Percent correct on selected graded problems. You can immediately see the decreasing percent correct on the first few problems. Does this indicate a genuine increased difficulty, or simply badly-written problems? Only examining the problems themselves will tell us.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Ungraded.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Ungraded.png" alt="" /></a>Percent correct on selected ungraded problems (from a pre-test, in this case). Problem 3 is either unexpectedly difficult, or incorrectly marked. You can see that every other problem has at least twice as high a percentage of correct answers.</p>
  <p><a href="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Video.png" target="_blank"><img src="/static/DASHBOARDS_Insights_Video.png" alt="" /></a>Percentage of videos watched in a particular subsection. Note that one video has a very low completion percentage - an indication that it needs to be examined. Is it boring? Incorrectly linked? Redundant? Is it missing sound?</p>
