<h4>Another Illustrative Example</h4>
<p>To illustrate the need for modeling student interactions with lessons, here is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6;">two-dimensional embedding with lessons and prerequisites:</span></p>
<p><img src="/static/ex4.png" type="saveimage" target="[object Object]" width="745" height="542" /></p>
<p>The outcomes build on the scenario presented earlier.&nbsp;Evan, Fogell, and Seth fail assessment A3, then complete lesson L1, then fail A3 again. Can you design&nbsp;an embedding without&nbsp;lessons that explains the outcomes in the log data? What do we gain from explicitly modeling prerequisites for lessons?</p>
