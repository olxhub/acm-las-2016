<h2>Cross-MOOC Classification Performance</h2>
<p>Table 3 includes the cross-domain MOOC accuracy where a model in trained on the forum posts from a single course and then validated with unseen forum posts from the other two courses. 
The cross-domain performance varies across categories. The sentiment cross-domain MOOC classifiers achieve the best performance (the lowest accuracy being 0.62) while the urgency and confusion classifiers are unable to produce consistent generalisable performance for MOOC courses from a different domain. The lowest accuracy is achieved for confusion classification (i.e., 0.25).

    <ul>
      <li>Many Transfer learning and domain adaptation algorithms have been proposed that allow classification algorithms to achieve improved performance when applied to other domain areas particularly for sentiment classification (e.g., applying a model trained on movie reviews to book reviews).</li>   
      <li>Table 4 includes the top words for each category within the DS 3 course (the features for the other 2 courses are omitted due to space restrictions), selected using the chi-squared statistic.</li>

  Table 4: Top features for each category selected using the chi-squared statistic for Science Stat Learning Winter 2014 (DS 3).
</p>
<p>
Inspection of the top features (words) in each category, revealed the reason for low performing cross-domain classification results:
<ul>  
<li>The top features for confusion and sentiment are highly related to the context in which the confusion or sentiment was expressed. 
  </li>
  <li>Confusion included words for the concepts that were found to be confusing</li>
  <li>Urgency was associated with technology issues that students may have required an urgent response</li> 
</ul>
</p>

  Please use the discussion forum to discuss the reasons for low cross-MOOC classifier performance.
