<h3 lang="en-US" class="western">Approach</h3>
<p lang="en-US" class="western">Computer tutors that can learn from interaction with students require training data. Therefore, our approach during this project was to create a suitable data collection system.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p lang="en-US" class="western">We started with Beetle II, a proven effective natural-language ITS for tutoring conceptual knowledge in the basic electricity and electronics domain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-US" class="western">We developed a new version of the system, Beetle-Grow, suitable for deployment on the web.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p lang="en-US" class="western">We created tools for logging the data collected from Beetle-Grow in a format suitable for data mining in the future.</p>
</li>
</ul>
