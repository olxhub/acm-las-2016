<p><span style="font-family: 'Open Sans', Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Welcome. As our live work is a demonstration, the content in this course is intended to help users working with the ASSISTments TestBed. The TestBed revolutionizes educational research by making it simple for researchers to design and implement low cost, high power, noninvasive randomized controlled experiments that feature student level randomization at scale and leverage ASSISTments' pre-existing content and user population. It is a unique collaborative funded by the <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1440753" target="[object Object]">National Science Foundation through an SI2 grant</a>&nbsp;that connects researchers and authentic learning environments with simplicity.</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">An introduction to the ASSISTments TestBed and the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure</span></li>
<li>The agenda and some sneak peaks for our demonstration</li>
<li>Pointers to useful resources to answer any additional questions</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">As you progress through the next few steps you will learn the benefits of using the ASSISTments TestBed, the typical workflow of using ASSISTments as a research tool, how to access data from the Assessment of Learning Infrastructure (ALI), a little bit about our demonstration agenda, and some important resources for getting started.
