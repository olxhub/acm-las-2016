<p>Beetle-Grow is an intelligent tutoring system which combines active experimentation, self-explanation, and formative feedback using natural language interaction. It runs in a standard web browser and has a fresh, engaging design. The underlying back-end system has previously been shown to be highly eï¬€ective in teaching basic electricity and electronics concepts.</p>
<p>Beetle-Grow has been designed to capture student interaction and indicators of learning in a form suitable for data mining, and to support future work on building tools for interactive tutoring that improve after experiencing interaction with students, as human tutors do.</p>
