<h4>Student Quotes</h4>
<p>&ldquo;I lost my interests in the Coursera forum after one week because it was very chaos. I didn&rsquo;t know people there because I guess most of them were not willing to make friends. They used fake name, which made me feel untrusted. So later, I used a fake name too. Also, I rarely received replies from them on Coursera and when I answered some questions, no thanks received. It&rsquo;s not like a human being interaction place. So I went to Facebook group, where I saw a totally different atmosphere... &rdquo;[P3]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I also introduced myself in Coursera but no people would carefully read it, which makes the introduction useless.&rdquo; [P7]</p>
<p>&ldquo;People will leave Coursera right after the course finish. Everything would be gone. So I didn&rsquo;t want to contribute much in the forum... At the beginning the course, I frequently asked questions on Coursera but no answers. After a while, I chose to ask questions on Facebook and it worked. Actually, I like answering question on Facebook, as least I received some thanks and we can have real interactions.&rdquo; [P11]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could use my Facebook account to login Coursera. I think I will have more visits on Coursera when they save the extra step for me to login.&rdquo; [P5]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I frequently forget my password or account name. I know this is stupid, but it happens frequently not just on me but on many of my friends!&rdquo; [P4]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, I actually want to reply or make some updates on Coursera, but when I think I need to login on my computer, I postponed doing it and then I forgot to do it later.&rdquo; [P12]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I usually forgot to check the Coursera and follow the MOOC schedule, especially when I was busy. But Facebook group posts and notifications would encourage me to squeeze sometime to watch more course lecture on Coursera and catch up the course schedules.&rdquo; [P2]</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we need is a place to collaborate on our group project but Coursera is really not an ideal one. Since there is no collaboration feature on Coursera, we appropriated the forum and added a new thread on the forum to divide some place for our project discussion. But we cannot control the access to the thread. We experienced lots of interruptions. So we gave up and adopted Facebook.&rdquo; [P8]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like reviewing Facebook posts and joining discussions with classmates, instructors and TAs there. The posts are usually interesting, for example, the instructor would share some useful materials or learning topic related knowledge. It is beneficial. Even just reviewing the discussions, I could learn more. I also received more replies from instructors and TAs than that on Coursera.&rdquo;[P1]</p>
<h4>Instructor Quotes</h4>

<p>&ldquo;Facebook is a very useful tool to enhance student communication quality and quantitate. Although Coursera has provided a discussion forum for students and instructors to communicate, I still feel hard to take effective and efficient communications.&rdquo; [Instructor 2]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Facebook is a great place for students and instructors to build some connections before the course. Since the MOOC usually only span 4 to 8 weeks, which is relatively short comparing with traditional course. Thus, it will be challenging to create a good learning environment. Building a Facebook group several weeks before the course start potentially gives students more time to cultivate a community&rdquo; [Instructor 4]</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Facebook, they have the opportunity to connect to fellow students to work on collaborative projects just as they will in the career world. This could help student have critical thinking and broaden their scope of current understanding. I am not saying the Coursera forum cannot do this, but I think social media can do a better job.&rdquo; [Instructor 3]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether this is because of the anonymous feature that allow students make a comment anonymously, I found students have very mean comments on both instructor and other students on Cousera.

I was actually disappointed when I go through the comments on Coursera.&rdquo; [Instructor 2]</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think a good community could arouse students interests and make students feel happy and comfortable to share their learning experiences.

I think the Facebook group of my course is a very successful community in this case. I was always inspired by their words.&rdquo; [Instructor 1]</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot imagine how painful I was when I tried to look through the comments. The design of the forum is very boring, especially when I need to go through so many comments...

<p>&ldquo;I doubt Facebook can do a better job if all the MOOC students joined in and had discussions in Facebook. But Facebook definitely looks better in terms of design, at least you won&rsquo;t feel bored.&rdquo; [Instructor 3]</p>
