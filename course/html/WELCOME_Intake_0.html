<p>A few of our goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a more effective means of knowledge transfer than sage-on-the-stage</li>
<li>The key reason to travel is to talk to people. We'd like to encourage more discussion, collaboration, interaction, and interactive activities at the conference</li>
<li>Allow some access to&nbsp;scholarly conferences to those who cannot attend</li>
<li>Turn science into a dialog: Provide a place for&nbsp;discussion around&nbsp;papers</li>
<li>Allow papers to provide information at whatever&nbsp;depth is required for full understanding and replication.&nbsp;We'd like to support readers who want to just have a quick glance, as well as those who want to go into depth</li>
<li>Allow data, demos, videos, and other&nbsp;rich content as needed to convey information about papers</li>
<li>Eat our own dogfood:&nbsp;Have researchers in Learning@Scale both create and consume MOOC content</li>
<li>Have more analytics about how researchers are viewing and&nbsp;leveraging each others' work</li>
</ul>
