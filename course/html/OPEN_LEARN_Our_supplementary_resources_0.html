<p>Drawing on ideas discussed by prof. Kester and dr. Rosmalen we would like to confront you with another design challenge related to open learning and MOOC design - designing complex learning in an open format.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This challenge is also based on a webinar held during the Open Education week 2016. In this webinar David Merrill's task based design model was presented as a possible model for open learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Watch the recording of this webinar&nbsp;on Task-centred MOOC design: challenges and opportunities organized by the EMMA project. Further information about the EMMA project and&nbsp;<a href="http://project.europeanmoocs.eu/project/get-involved/webinar-series/" target="_blank">webinar series</a> you can find at the EMMA website.</p>
<p>1. Follow the presentation of the Task-centred design model van dr. Mart Laanpere. While listening to the presentation, think of the challenge of open and massive learning design with which we started. What are in your opinion the biggest challenges of implementing task-centred design as described by dr. Laanpere?</p>
<p>2. Follow the second part of the presentation in which dr. Olga Firssova elaborated on a single instance of&nbsp;an online learning task-centred design. In this design some challenges are tackled, other remain unresolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What challenges may be considered tackled? What issues remain unsolved? What design solutions would you consider appropriate in implementing task-centred design in open learning?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Share your thoughts with us in this MOOC and at the L@S conference!</p>
