<h2>Cross-MOOC Classification Performance</h2>
<p>I was able to illustrate that while good cross-validated classifier performance for confusion, urgency and sentiment detection in MOOC forums for a specific course is able to be achieved, that these results do not generalise well when applied to MOOC forum posts originating from other domain areas. Future research will involve evaluating transfer learning and domain adaptation algorithms that are able to address issues associated with MOOC domain specific features (i.e., words). 
  <ul>
    <li>It is hoped that this early research will trigger further sharing of human coded data sets for supervised machine learning evaluation.</li>
    <li>The next steps for the research include conducting a literature review to find algorithms that are able to exclude domain specific words or find related pivot words in cross-domain datasets. A domain adaptation technique known as structural correspondence learning is an example of an algorithm that leverages pivot features.</li>
    <li>Allowing teaching staff to provide seed words for a classifier is also an option.</li>
</ul>
