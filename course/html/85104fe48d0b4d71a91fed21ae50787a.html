<p>Before you start the presentation, we'd like you to pause for a moment and put down your expectations for this system. But to do that, you need to know just a little bit about the system. Note that these questions are answered in the abstract, so please answer here before you proceed!</p>
<p>When a student in a Udacity Nanodegree program submits a project, it is sent to external project reviewers. Any project reviewer qualified to evaluate that project can claim the project, grade it, provide written feedback, and return it to the student. The reviewer is paid per project that they evaluate, from $5 for simple projects to $60 for more complex projects. This system has three goals: to improve how many projects can be evaluated per day, to improve how quickly students receive feedback, and to give students high-quality feedback.</p>
