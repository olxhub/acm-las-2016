<p>Despite the ubiquitous use of videos in online learning and enormous literature on designing online learning, there has been relatively little research on what pedagogical strategies should be used to make the most of video lessons and what constitutes an effective video for student learning. We experimented with a model of incorporating four pedagogical strategies, four instructional phases, and four production guidelines-in designing and developing video lessons for an online graduate course. In this paper, we share our experience as well as students&rsquo; perceptions of their effectiveness. We also discuss what needs to be done for future research.</p>
