<p>You can add any questions you have about using AXIS or the underlying MOOClet Technology in the GDoc&nbsp;<a href="http://tiny.cc/axisgdoc" target="_blank">tiny.cc/axisgdoc</a>, or in either the Discussion Forum or Askalot Question Answering below. We'll look at all of these and discuss them in the Flipped Session.</p>
<p>Please make sure to give your answer to one of these questions, by posting in the&nbsp;<a href="http://tiny.cc/axisgdoc" target="_blank" style="line-height: 25.6px;">tiny.cc/axisgdoc</a>&nbsp;or below.</p>
<p>Where do you think instructors and researchers would like to use systems like AXIS? e.g. in non-mathematical quizzes on EdX? Local quizzes in Canvas?</p>
<p>What are the&nbsp;improvements you think AXIS needs to make? What are its current limitations?</p>
