<p>Beetle-Grow harnesses the proven educational potential of the Beetle II system and makes it available to a new audience. The browser-based user interface makes deployment at scale straightforward. We have&nbsp;conÔ¨Ådence that Beetle-Grow will help students to learn, while simultaneously allowing us to collect a large corpus of interaction data for future analysis.</p>
<p>As our next step, we are interested in partnering with teachers and other education researchers to carry out large scale user trials with Beetle-Grow in the classroom and remotely. Data from such trials will generate new insights into the effect of active experimentation on learning in the domain of basic electricity and electronics.</p>
<p>Student answers and interaction data collected from these trials could be used to train statistical algorithms (Dzikovska et al., 2013) in order to provide better student feedback in a future version of Beetle-Grow.</p>
