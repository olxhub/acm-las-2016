<h4><strong>DEER: Facilitating Distributed Assessment by NON-EXPERTS!</strong></h4>
<h5>The ASSESSOR is:</h5>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Recruited by the MOOC participant</li>
<li>Located geographically close to the MOOC participant</li>
<li>A respected member of the participant's community</li>
<li>Not necessarily an expert in MOOC content</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h5>The MOOC provides:</h5>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Project instructions for the PARTICIPANT which require understanding of MOOC content</li>
<li>Assessment instructions for the ASSESSOR which can be performed without content knowledge</li>
<li>A certificate that is only "valid" when endorsed by the assessor.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The DEER review was developed for our <a href="http://elvis.rowan.edu/~kay/cs4hs/" target="[object Object]">EDUCATIONAL ROBOTS FOR ABSOLUTE BEGINNERS MOOCs</a> which are designed to introduce K-12 teachers to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_NXT" target="[object Object]">LEGO NXT </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstorms_EV3" target="[object Object]">LEGO EV3</a> Robot programming languages</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Both the NXT Programming Language and the EV3 Programming Language are visual block-based languages</li>
<li>When MOOC participants affirm that they have completed the MOOC, they are permitted to download a certificate of completion</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>BUT, the certificate says "Not valid without principal's signature"!</li>
<li>The principal is asked to assess whether participants have completed the projects based on robot behavior rather than on an understanding of the programming itself.</li>
</ul>
