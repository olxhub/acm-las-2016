<h3><strong>Backend: AXIS Explanation Selection Policy</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Figure 1:&nbsp;</strong>An illustration of the problem the backend for the Explanation Selection Policy has to solve, and the kind of approach taken.</p>

<p>We formulate this as a&nbsp;multi-armed bandit problem, of experimentation that trades off showing the highest rated explanation with discovering which is highest rated.</p>
<p>The algorithm we use is Bayesian, Thompson Sampling, which uses weighted random sampling of explanations. The probability of an explanation being chosen is equal to the probability that it is the explanation with the highest rating (which depends on our statistical model, evidence collected).</p>
<p>We model the probability that an explanation will be judged helpful, p_helpful, using a Beta(a,b) distribution. For the likelihood term, a&nbsp;student's rating of explanation helpfulness on a scale from 1 to 10 is modeled as generated by a Binomial Distribution (n = 10, p = p_helpful) with 10 draws, and the probability of "success" following the Beta(a,b) distribution.</p>
<p>The prior distribution over the probability of each explanation being helpful is modeled as Beta(19,1). This can be interpreted as having observed two fictional student ratings, one a 9/10 and one a 10/10. We chose this because it is <strong>optimistic&nbsp;</strong>- expecting any explanation to be highly rated, and so presenting it frequently to explore what its true rating is&ndash; but&nbsp;<strong>uncertain&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; the first few student ratings will rapidly balance out the prior assumptions.&nbsp;</p>
