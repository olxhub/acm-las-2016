<p>This is a good place to place additional resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give links to github repos, data, and other resources</li>
<li>Provide more technical detail. Ideally, people should be able to vet methodology, replicate your results, and similar</li>
<li>Any other information you think might be helpful to a minority of the conference participants.</li>
<li>Are you looking for collaborations? To interact with other people? This might be a good place to provide a bit more project information, whom you'd be interested in speaking to, and how.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to go overboard.</p>
